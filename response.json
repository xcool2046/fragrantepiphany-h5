{"is_unlocked":false,"past":{"card_name":"The Fool","category":"Self","position":"Past","language":"en","summary":"Trust your intuition and take a leap of faith into the unknown.","interpretation":"The Fool in the past suggests your life began in a state of 'freedom, innocence, and boundlessness.' You were likely never the child who followed the rules or grew up by the formula; instead, you were the traveler with a backpack, eager to try everything. While others hesitated, weighing pros and cons, you had already taken that step—changing schools, environments, or venturing where no one knew you. You possessed an innate trust in life, believing that 'if I walk, the answers will appear.'\nInternally, you valued the 'sensation of being alive' over safe templates. Fixed identities and rigid paths felt suffocating. You carved out space for yourself in seemingly reckless ways: leaving unsuitable circles, refusing labels, and making decisions others couldn't understand. You were intuitive with your emotions—laughing when happy, crying when sad, without disguise.\nOf course, you stumbled. Impulsiveness brought wounds, and trust brought disappointment. Yet, these were your unique lessons. You learned to balance courage with discernment, to glance at the ground before leaping. The Fool reminds you: your soul’s original setting is that of a curious traveler. Even now, as you mature, the instinct to 'take the first step' still resides within you.","action":null,"future":null,"recommendation":"Trust your intuition and take a leap of faith into the unknown.","is_locked":false},"present":{"summary":null,"interpretation":null,"is_locked":true},"future":{"summary":null,"interpretation":null,"is_locked":true}}
