It is more like an ancient temple touched by sunlight and breeze for hundreds of years.\nStepping into the temple: The top note is dry cypress and cedar with a hint of green. Not the vibrant trees in the forest, but wood that has been felled, planed, and weathered, losing its fire. It carries a hint of ascetic coldness, as if you push open a heavy wooden door, the interior is dim, dust dancing in the light columns, the air filled with a secluded tranquility. This is the embodiment of '4 of Swords' —— a chosen solitude with restorative meaning."
